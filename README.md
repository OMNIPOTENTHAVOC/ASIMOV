# ASIMOV PARTIAL_DEPENDENCIES

This repository contains codes for simple system autonomy, incorporating Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), a direcory containing codes to read, extract and plot sensor data (MQ135, MPU6050) in real-time and motor control codes for the Cytron motor driver. All of these are integral for making ASIMOV work and function as intended.
